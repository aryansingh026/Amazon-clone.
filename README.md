# Amazon-clone.


**HTML Structure** :

The code starts with the DOCTYPE declaration specifying the document type as HTML.

The <html> tag defines the root of the HTML document.

Inside <html>, the <head> tag contains meta information about the webpage.

Character encoding is set to UTF-8 (<meta charset="UTF-8">).
Viewport is set to adjust the page width for various devices (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">).
The <title> tag defines the title displayed on the browser tab ("Amazon" in this case).
A link tag (<link>) is used to include the Font Awesome library (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.6.0/css/all.min.css) for icons.
Another link tag references an external stylesheet named "amazon.css" (<link rel ="stylesheet" href ="amazon.css">) which likely contains most of the styling for the website.
The <body> tag contains the visible content of the webpage.

> I have used Font-Awesome application for making logos like symbol of location, cart, search bar etc. So, used these like application to make page more attractive.


**Header Section:**

A <header> tag defines the header section of the webpage.

Inside the header, a <div> with the class "navbar" represents the navigation bar.
The navbar contains elements like the logo, delivery address, search bar, sign-in/account options, and a shopping cart icon. Each element is styled using a separate class (e.g., .nav-logo, .nav-address, etc.).
Font Awesome icons are used for location, search, and shopping cart functionalities.
Another <div> with the class "panel" displays additional options like "Today's Deals," "Customer Service," etc.
Following the navbar and panel sections, there's a <div> with the class "hero-section" that likely displays a hero image or message.

Shop Section (lines 233-432):

A <div> with the class "shop-section" contains multiple product boxes arranged in a grid layout using flexbox properties.
Each product box is a separate <div> with the class "box".
Inside the box, a <div> with the class "box-content" displays the product category (e.g., "Health & Personal Care").
Another <div> with the class "box-img" uses background-image to display the product image.
A paragraph with text "See More" is likely a link to the product details page.
Footer Section (lines 433-532):

A <footer> tag defines the website footer.
The footer contains sections for "Back to Top," links ("Get to Know Us"), logo, legal links ("Conditions of Use", etc.), and copyright information.
CSS Styling (lines 533-end):

The CSS styles are likely defined in a separate file named "amazon.css" (linked in the <head> section). This code snippet only shows a small part of the CSS that sets basic styles for various elements like margins, fonts, colors, background colors, etc.
Overall, this code provides a basic structure for a webpage resembling the Amazon homepage layout. It includes elements like a navigation bar, search bar, product sections, and a footer. The website's visual design and interactivity would depend on the additional CSS styles defined in the "amazon.css" file and any JavaScript code that might be included.
